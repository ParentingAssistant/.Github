# Parenting Assistant – AI-Powered Tools for Modern Parents

Welcome to the **Parenting Assistant** GitHub organization!

This initiative is a hands-on prototype project exploring how **AI technologies** can be leveraged to support modern parenting needs. The work spans both **product and engineering**, using a real-world MVP to showcase the application of **Generative AI**, thoughtful product design, and cloud-native architectures—all created with the aid of AI tools from end to end.

---

## **Mission & Motivation**

Parenting today is overwhelming and often undersupported. The **Parenting Assistant** is built to answer a simple question:

> **How can we use AI to offload, optimize, and enrich the most repetitive, mental-load-heavy tasks of raising children?**

This prototype focuses on designing and testing AI-powered features that directly address the day-to-day challenges of parents—while also serving as a case study in modern product development powered by **AI copilots**.

---

## **Project Overview**

The project is composed of two main applications:

### **1. [iOS App (Frontend)](https://github.com/ParentingAssistant/ParentingAssistant-iOS)**
- Built in **SwiftUI** using **Cursor AI**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **design-to-code workflows** powered by **Galileo AI** and **Banana**.
- Features a clean, engaging UI with user-focused onboarding, navigation, and AI tools.
- Fully integrated with Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and RESTful APIs from the backend.

### **2. [Node.js Backend (API Server)](https://github.com/ParentingAssistant/ParentingAssistantBackend)**
- Written in **TypeScript** using **Express**, **Redis**, and **Firebase Admin SDK**.
- Deployed to **Google Cloud Run** with GitHub Actions CI/CD.
- Integrates with the **OpenAI API** for real-time AI content generation.
- Implements rate-limiting, caching, and secure authentication.

---

## **AI-Powered Features in the MVP**

The current MVP includes:

### **1. Meal Prep Assistant**
- AI-generated weekly meal plans based on preferences.
- Kid-friendly recipes with guided cooking flow.
- Smart shopping list generation.

### **2. Bedtime Story Generator**
- Personalized AI stories based on child’s name, age, and interest.
- Option to save and revisit favorite stories.
- Optional voice reading and playback.

## **AI Tools Used**

| Category | Tool |
|---------|------|
| Code Generation | [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.sh), GitHub Copilot |
| UI Design | [Galileo AI](https://www.usegalileo.ai), Banani |
| AI Integration | OpenAI GPT-4 APIs |
| Backend Infra | Firebase, Redis, GCP Cloud Run |
| Testing & Linting | Jest, ESLint |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Deployment | Docker + GCP |

All prompts, backend endpoints, UI screens, and workflows were ideated, written, or reviewed with the help of **Generative AI**—including the planning and documentation phases.

## **Steps Taken Using AI Tools**

1. **Product Definition**  
   Used ChatGPT and Cursor to generate product requirements, PRDs, and feature breakdowns.

2. **Design**  
   Prompted Galileo AI and Banani to generate visually clean and UX-oriented mockups for each screen.

3. **Frontend Development**  
   - Created SwiftUI views using Cursor and Copilot.
   - Integrated designs from Figma-like output into working code.
   - Firebase Auth and API hooks handled by AI-prompted generation.

4. **Backend Development**  
   - Used GPT to design scalable architecture (Express, Redis, Firebase Admin).
   - Auto-generated endpoints, rate limiters, caching layers.
   - Deployed with Docker + GitHub Actions + Cloud Run.

5. **End-to-End Integration**  
   - Designed prompts for OpenAI APIs for meal planning and storytelling.
   - Connected frontend to backend using secure tokens.

## **How to Run Locally**

Each repo contains a `README.md` with detailed instructions for local development, API keys setup, and Firebase integration. You’ll need:

- Node.js & npm
- Xcode (for iOS app)
- Firebase credentials
- OpenAI API key
- Redis or Upstash account

---

## **Next Steps**

- [ ] Add more AI verticals: routines, emotional needs, family scheduling, entertainment, etc.
- [ ] Expand onboarding to personalize AI recommendations.
- [ ] Improve UI polish using Figma and custom design system.
- [ ] Enhance caching and logging for production scale.
- [ ] Open the platform for partnerships with services, marketplaces, and educators.
- [ ] Prepare for App Store submission (TestFlight & compliance steps).
